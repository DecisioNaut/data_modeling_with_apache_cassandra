    "# Data Modeling With Apache Cassandra\n",
    "***A Project in Course of Udacity's Nano-Degree for Data Engineering With AWS***\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Task\n",
    "***As provided by Udacity***\n",
    "\n",
    "A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app.  \n",
    "\n",
    "They'd like a data engineer to create an Apache Cassandra database which can create queries on song play data to answer the questions, and wish to bring you on the project. Your role is to create a database for this analysis. You'll be able to test your database by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify to create the results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, they'd like you to create tables in Apache Cassandra to run the following queries:\n",
    "1. Give me the artist, song title and song's length in the music app history that was heard during  sessionId = 338, and itemInSession  = 4\n",
    "2. Give me only the following: name of artist, song (sorted by itemInSession) and user (first and last name) for userid = 10, sessionid = 182\n",
    "3. Give me every user name (first and last) in my music app history who listened to the song 'All Hands Against His Own'  \n",
    "\n",
    "Udacity splits the project in two parts:\n",
    "Part 1: ETL Pipeline for Pre-Processing the Files\n",
    "Part II. Complete the Apache Cassandra coding portion of your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of the reviewer, I stick to this division."

    "\n",
    "Cassandra is a No-SQL database or, more specifically, a key-value store.\n",
    "In order to setup the database, it makes sense to think of the use cases in terms of queries first. This helps to design the tables required to later perform the queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use cases:\n",
    "1. Give me the artist, song title and song's length in the music app history that was heard during  sessionId = 338, and itemInSession  = 4\n",
    "2. Give me only the following: name of artist, song (sorted by itemInSession) and user (first and last name) for userid = 10, sessionid = 182\n",
    "3. Give me every user name (first and last) in my music app history who listened to the song 'All Hands Against His Own'  \n",
    "\n",
    "This translates to the following queries:\n",
    "1. `SELECT artist, song, length FROM [database with appropriate structure] WHERE sessionId = 338 AND itemInSession = 4`\n",
    "2. `SELECT artist, song, firstName, lastName FROM [database with appropriate structure] WHERE userId = 10 AND sessionId = 182`\n",
    "3. `SELECT firstName, lastName FROM [database with appropriate structure] WHERE song = 'All Hands Against His Own'`\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we need to think about the ordering by `itemInSession` as requested by use case 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we'd like to perform `WHERE` clauses on then `sessionId`, `itemInSession`, `userId`, and `song` should be included in the respective primary keys.\n",
    "It seems likely that the combination of `sessionId` and `itemInSession` is unique for each row, as one can assume that these ids are generated especially to keep track of individual sessions."
